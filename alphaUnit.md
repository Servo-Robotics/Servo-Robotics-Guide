## Motion Systems

### Four basic types of motion:

1. Rotary Motion
	* Turning around
2. Linear Motion
	* Moving in a straight line
3. Reciprocating Motion
	* Moving back and forth
4. Oscillating Motion
	* Swinging from side to side

*Most mechanical systems use a type of input motion that is converted to an output motion.*
